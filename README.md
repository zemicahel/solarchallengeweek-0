# Solar Data Discovery: 10 Academy Week 0 Challenge



This repository contains the solution for the Week 0 Challenge of the 10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery program. The project focuses on the analysis of solar farm data from three West African countries—Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo—to provide data-driven strategic recommendations for future solar investments.

## Business Objective
As an Analytics Engineer at **MoonLight Energy Solutions**, the primary goal is to analyze environmental and solar measurement data to identify high-potential regions for solar farm installations. The analysis aims to uncover key trends and insights that support a strategic investment plan, aligning with the company's long-term sustainability and operational efficiency goals. The final output is a strategy report based on statistical analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains aggregated solar radiation measurement data from solar farms in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Each record includes meteorological and solar irradiance measurements. Key features include:
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the observation.
- **Solar Irradiance**: `GHI` (Global), `DNI` (Direct), `DHI` (Diffuse).
- **Module Readings**: `ModA`, `ModB`, `TModA`, `TModB`.
- **Weather Metrics**: `Tamb` (Ambient Temperature), `RH` (Relative Humidity), `WS` (Wind Speed), `WD` (Wind Direction), `BP` (Barometric Pressure).
- **Events**: `Cleaning` and `Precipitation`.

## Project Structure
The repository follows a structured layout to ensure modularity and reproducibility.
